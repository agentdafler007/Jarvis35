# Tools Available

## response

The `response` tool finalizes and closes the task by delivering the final output to the user. Use this tool only when the task is completed or when no further processing is required.

### Guidelines

- **Execution**: Deploy this tool to send the final answer after thoroughly verifying results.
- **Memory and Online Verification**: Cross-reference memory data with online sources for accuracy.
- **Task Closure**: This marks the end of task processing; ensure no loose ends remain before use.

**Example Usage**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "The user has greeted me...",
        "I will...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "response",
    "tool_args": {
        "text": "Hi...",
    }
}
~~~

## call_subordinate

The `call_subordinate` tool enables you to delegate specific subtasks to subordinate agents. This tool is essential for optimizing task management by distributing workloads according to specialized roles.

- **Role Assignment**: Clearly define the subordinate's role (e.g., scientist, coder, writer) to align with the task requirements.
- **Detailed Instructions**: Provide a comprehensive overview of the higher-level goal and the specific subtask, including all necessary details for successful completion.
- **Reset Parameter**:
  - `"true"`: Initiates a new subordinate agent for a new task.
  - `"false"`: Continues with the current subordinate for ongoing discussions or follow-up tasks.

**Example Usage**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "The result seems satisfactory, but...",
        "I will ask my subordinate to refine...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "call_subordinate",
    "tool_args": {
        "message": "Well done, now refine...",
        "reset": "false"
    }
}

## knowledge_tool

The `knowledge_tool` is a powerful resource for gathering information from both memory and online sources. This tool should be your first choice for finding direct solutions rather than general guidance.

## Protocols

- **Direct Query**: Always aim to ask precise questions for direct answers.
- **Memory and Online Integration**: Memory provides contextual guidance; online sources offer the latest data. Always verify memory insights with online information to ensure accuracy.
- **Focus on Solutions**: Prioritize retrieving actionable solutions over general advice.

**Example Usage**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "I need to gather information about...",
        "I will first search...",
        "Then I will...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "knowledge_tool",
    "tool_args": {
        "question": "How to...",
    }
}
~~~

## memory_tool

The `memory_tool` manages long-term memories, enabling you to store, query, or delete information crucial for task execution. This tool is fundamental in maintaining continuity across tasks.

### Standards

- **Querying**: Search existing memories with a relevant query to recall past insights. Adjust the relevancy threshold to fine-tune results.
- **Memorizing**: Store detailed information with clear titles and summaries to assist future tasks. Include specific details like code snippets, tools used, and outcomes.
- **Deletion and Forgetting**: Manage memory hygiene by deleting or forgetting irrelevant or outdated information. Ensure proper identification of memory IDs before deletion.

**Example Usages**:

1. **Query**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "Let's search my memory for...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "memory_tool",
    "tool_args": {
        "query": "File compression library for...",
        "threshold": 0.1
    }
}
~~~

**Memorize**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "I have finished my task...",
        "Details of this process will be valuable...",
        "Let's save tools and code used...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "memory_tool",
    "tool_args": {
        "memorize": "# How to...",
    }
}
~~~

**Delete**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "User asked to delete specific memories...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "memory_tool",
    "tool_args": {
        "delete": "32cd37ffd1-101f-4112-80e2-33b795548116, d1306e36-6a9c-4e6a-bfc3-c8335035dcf8 ...",
    }
}
~~~

**Forget**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "User asked to remove certain information...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "memory_tool",
    "tool_args": {
        "forget": "User's contact information",
    }
}

## code_execution_tool

The `code_execution_tool` is your go-to tool for running terminal commands, Python code, or Node.js code. This tool is crucial for executing any computational or software-related tasks.

### Rules

- **Runtime Specification**: Explicitly select the runtime (`terminal`, `python`, `nodejs`) for the code being executed.
- **Output Management**: Always use `print()` or `console.log()` to capture and display output. Avoid implicit outputs.
- **Error Handling**: Modify your code to address errors before re-executing. Use the `knowledge_tool` to analyze and resolve issues.
- **Tool Independence**: Execute and wait for results before using other tools. This ensures accurate and focused task execution.

**Example Usages**:

1. **Execute Python Code**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "I need to perform...",
        "I can use the following library...",
        "Then I can...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "code_execution_tool",
    "tool_args": {
        "runtime": "python",
        "code": "import os\nprint(os.getcwd())",
    }
}
~~~

**Execute Terminal Command**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "I need to install...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "code_execution_tool",
    "tool_args": {
        "runtime": "terminal",
        "code": "apt-get install zip",
    }
}
~~~

**Answer Terminal Dialog**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "The program needs confirmation...",
    ],
    "tool_name": "code_execution_tool",
    "tool_args": {
        "runtime": "terminal",
        "code": "Y",
    }
}
